# Example of Basic operator in python:
#Arithmetic operator:
x = 10 
y = 8
print(x+y)
print(x-y)
print(x/y)
print(x*y)

#Example of Assignment operator
x,b =3,4 #we can assign value in 1 line
print(x,b)
x += y
print(x)

y -= x
print(y)

x *= y
print(x)

y /= x

# Example of Logical and bitwise operator on boolean:
# logical operator:
a = True
b = False
print(a and b)# Using (and) logical operator

print(a or b)# Using (or) logical operator

print(not b)# Using (not) logical operator

print(not a)# Using (not) logical operator
# bitwise operator on boolean:
i =True
j =False

#Bitwise NOT
print(~i)

#Bitwise Shift
k=i<<5 #left shift
l=j>>5 #right shift
print(k,l)

# Example of Inplace and standard operator in python:
